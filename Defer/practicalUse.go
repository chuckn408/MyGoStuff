/*
There is one more advantage of using defer in the above program. 
Letâ€™s say we add another return path to the area method using a
 new if condition. If the call to wg.Done() was not deferred, 
 we have to be careful and ensure that we call wg.Done() in 
 this new return path. But since the call to wg.Done() is 
 defered, we need not worry about adding new return paths to 
 this method.

this was straightforward enough... having visual reps
like in prev examples helped a lot and reminded me
of some sims i played on steam

This program will first print Main going to call
 hello go goroutine. Then the hello Goroutine will 
be started and it will print hello go routine is 
going to sleep. After this is printed, the hello 
Goroutine will sleep for 4 seconds and during this
 time main Goroutine will be blocked since it is 
waiting for data from the done channel in line no.
 18 <-done. After 4 seconds hello go routine awake
 and going to write to done will be printed 
followed by Main received data.
